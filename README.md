# Tic Tac Toe Game

## About Me

Hey there! I'm Parth Kumbhar, currently a third year under grad at MIT-WPU for Btech program of Computer Science and Business Systems Course. This Tic Tac Toe game is one of my recent creations using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoyed exploring javascript and responsive front-end technologies for building game that bring joy to users.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a classic Tic Tac Toe game implemented entirely in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a simple yet engaging game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The game ends when one player achieves three marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when there are no more empty spaces left.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode:** Players can take turns playing as 'X' and 'O'.
- **Win Detection:** The game detects and announces when a player wins or when the game ends in a draw.
- **New Game Button:** Allows players to start a new game without refreshing the page.
- **Responsive Design:** Basic styling ensures the game is playable and looks good on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structure of the game board and UI elements.
- **CSS:** Styling for layout, buttons, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript:** Game logic including player turns, win detection, and new game functionality.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git
   ```

2. **Open `Tic-Tac-Toe.html` in your browser.**

3. **Playing the game:**
   - Click on an empty cell to place your mark (X or O).
   - Alternate turns with your opponent.
   - The game will notify you when someone wins or if it's a draw.
   - Use the "New Game" button to reset the board and start over.


## Future Improvements

- **AI Opponent:** Implement a computer player with varying difficulty levels.
- **Enhanced Styling:** Add more visual elements and animations to enhance user experience.
- **Multiplayer Online:** Enable multiplayer functionality over the internet using WebSockets or Firebase.
